When working with Vue components, prioritize writing unit tests that cover component rendering, props handling, events, and computed properties. Use Vitest to create these tests, ensuring that each component behaves as expected in isolation.
When applying classes or styles to Vue components, ensure that they are consistent with the overall design system of the application. Avoid inline styles, and always use tailwind 4 classes, never custom classes with scoped css.
